# Fine-Tuning GPT Model for Custom Responses

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) for generating custom responses to specific prompts, using Hugging Face's `transformers`, `datasets`, and other supporting libraries. The goal of this project is to create a model that can respond to instructions with relevant, context-aware answers by fine-tuning it on a custom dataset.

## Problem Statement & Goal

The goal of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset of instructions and responses. The model is trained to generate relevant responses to user input based on the context in the dataset. This can be useful for applications such as chatbots, troubleshooting assistants, and more.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides access to pre-trained models and tools for fine-tuning.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for model training.
- **Hugging Face Datasets**: For managing and preprocessing datasets.
- **Weights & Biases (WandB)**: Used for tracking experiments, visualizing metrics, and logging training progress.
- **BitsAndBytes**: Optimizes memory usage during training, allowing large models to be fine-tuned on machines with limited GPU memory.
- **Accelerate**: A library for optimizing multi-GPU or distributed training.
- **CUDA**: For GPU acceleration, ensuring faster training times.

## Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### 1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets peft accelerate bitsandbytes huggingface_hub wandb
```

### 2. Install system dependencies (if necessary):
```bash
!apt-get install libstdc++6
!apt-get update
!apt-get upgrade -y libstdc++6
```

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of pairs of "instructions" and "responses." It is in JSON format and can be converted into a Hugging Face Dataset format for training. The structure of the dataset is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "instruction": "How to install Python?",
    "response": "You can install Python by visiting the official Python website and downloading the installer."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is a neural network?",
    "response": "A neural network is a model inspired by the way human brains process information to solve complex tasks."
  }
]
```

---

## Training & Fine-Tuning

1. **Loading Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer**: We use a pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The model is fine-tuned on the custom dataset using PyTorch.

2. **Tokenization**: The instructions and responses are tokenized and processed into the correct format for causal language modeling.

3. **Training Setup**: The model is fine-tuned using a batch size of 1 and gradient accumulation to simulate a larger batch size. The `TrainingArguments` are set to specify saving steps, logging intervals, and gradient accumulation.

4. **Memory Optimization**: The model is fine-tuned using `bitsandbytes` to optimize memory usage during training, allowing the fine-tuning of larger models even on limited GPU memory.

---

## Usage

After fine-tuning the model, you can use it to generate responses based on input prompts. The model can be loaded and used for inference in the following way:

### Example Usage:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")

# Example input prompt
input_text = "How do I fix a slow computer?"

# Tokenize the input text
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# Generate model output (inference)
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)

# Decode and print the generated text
result = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(result)
```

---

## Model Inference

Once the model is trained, you can run inference with new prompts. The model will generate responses based on the custom fine-tuning it underwent. The model’s responses can be controlled by setting the `max_length` for the generated sequence, which dictates the length of the response.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **GPU Memory Overflows**: During training, GPU memory overflows were a concern due to the large size of the models. To mitigate this, I used `bitsandbytes` for 8-bit precision and reduced the batch size while leveraging gradient accumulation to simulate larger batches.
  
- **Training Time**: Fine-tuning large models took a considerable amount of time. I mitigated this by using GPU acceleration (CUDA) on Google Colab, which significantly sped up the process.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Larger Datasets**: The current dataset is relatively small. Expanding the dataset with more diverse and complex instructions/responses could improve the model’s performance and generalization.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of training steps could lead to better fine-tuning results.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implementing evaluation strategies like perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation could provide more insights into the model’s performance.
